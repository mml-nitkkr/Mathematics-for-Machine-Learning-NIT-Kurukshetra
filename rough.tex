Pivot columns and are independent column vectors
column is first, it has to be independent as long as it is not zero(as there is no vector on left of it)
This column vector(original one too) must be just 3 times the first one
The column vector(corresponding original one) is \textit{linear independent} of the first 2 vectors given on the left
